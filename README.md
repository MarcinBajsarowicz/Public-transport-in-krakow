Cracow’s public transport system is one of the most efficient in Poland, serving residents and tourists alike. It includes an extensive network of trams and buses that operate throughout the city and suburbs. Managed by MPK Kraków, the system emphasizes punctuality, cleanliness, and affordability, making urban travel smooth and convenient.

Trams are especially popular in Cracow due to their speed and frequency. Many lines run through key areas such as the Old Town, Kazimierz, and Nowa Huta. Modern low-floor trams are accessible for people with disabilities, while ticket machines and mobile apps make purchasing fares easy. Night lines also ensure round-the-clock connectivity.

Buses complement the tram system by reaching areas without tram tracks. Express and agglomeration lines serve commuters from surrounding towns. The introduction of eco-friendly electric and hybrid buses reflects the city’s sustainability goals. Cracow also integrates public bike rentals and ride-sharing options to support a more flexible transport network.
